# Airline-Management-System-Java-OOP-Project
A Java-based project to manage flights, passengers, and tickets using OOP concepts, Java Streams, and custom exceptions.
# ✈ Java Airline Management System

A **Java-based Airline Management System** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, **Java Streams API**, and **Custom Exceptions**.  
This project demonstrates clean code architecture with proper file separation, making it easy to understand, maintain, and extend.
